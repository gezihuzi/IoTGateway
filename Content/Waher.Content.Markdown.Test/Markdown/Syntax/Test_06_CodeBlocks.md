    This is a code block.

Here is an example of AppleScript:

    tell application "Foo"
        beep
    end tell

Fenced code block:

```
<div class="footer">
    &copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
</div>
```

Fenced code block (with syntax highlighting):

```basic

10 PRINT "*";

20 GOTO 10

```

Headers can also be written on a single line, prefixing them with hash signs (`#`) and a space character. The number of hash signs defines the level of
the header:

	# First level header
	
	## Second level header
	
	### Third level header
	
	#### Fourth level header
	
	...
